# üì∏ AffinityFlow

A lightweight, fast, and intuitive photo cataloging tool designed for photographers who use **Affinity Photo** but miss the powerful cataloging and batch workflow features of Lightroom Classic.

AffinityFlow lets you organize, rate, preview, tag, and batch-export RAW photos ‚Äî and seamlessly open them in **Affinity Photo** for final edits.

---

## üéØ Why AffinityFlow?

Affinity Photo is a powerful image editor ‚Äî but it lacks a built-in library, RAW batch processing, or photo management tools. Lightroom users enjoy powerful cataloging and workflow features, but Affinity users are left piecing together solutions manually.

AffinityFlow bridges that gap.
